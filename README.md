# Skylanders Autonomous Chooser

The sequel to the beloved "Skylanders: Autonomous Adventure" is finally here! Introducing "Skylanders: Autonomous Chooser", the newest installment to the "Skylanders: Autonomous" series. In this exciting and useless installment, you can now assign a certain autonomous command group as your autonomous command group with skylanders! <br>

notes: <br>
- works if you set an empty command to a command and then schedule it in the CommandScheduler <br>
- file must not have multiple setters to the empty command <br>
- can use rfid tags, dont need to use only skylanders, but its recommended because of how fun it is <br>
- modify strings in the beggining of the code to your likings <br>
